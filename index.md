### About 
My research interest is the intersection of **Machine Learning** and **Dynamical Systems**. In particular, my research is directed toward data-driven model reduction methods in the context of stochastic dynamical systems. 

Previously, I was a Postdoctoral Fellow at Johns Hopkins University. I received a PhD in applied math from the University of Washington, advised by Hong Qian. Here is my latest [CV](https://www.dropbox.com/s/955nv166vh1te03/main.pdf?dl=0) and [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=XOUnkpUAAAAJ&hl=en).

### Teaching
In Fall 2023, I am teaching Practical Machine Learning (AMAT593) and Applied Stochastic Process (AMAT 560).




### Miscellaneous
This is an [article](https://amath.washington.edu/news/2018/10/25/it-was-roller-coaster-ride) I wrote after I graduate from University of Washington.

I am a mentor for [Prison Mathematics Project](https://www.prisonmathproject.org/).
