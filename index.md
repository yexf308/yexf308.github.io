### About 
My research interest is the intersection of **Machine Learning** and **Dynamical Systems**. In particular, my research is directed toward data-driven model reduction methods in the context of stochastic dynamical systems. 

Previously, I was a Postdoctoral Fellow at Johns Hopkins University. I received a PhD in applied math from the University of Washington, advised by Hong Qian. Here is my latest [CV](https://www.dropbox.com/s/955nv166vh1te03/main.pdf?dl=0) and [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=XOUnkpUAAAAJ&hl=en).
