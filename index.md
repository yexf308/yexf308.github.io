### About 
My research interest is the intersection of **Machine Learning** and **Dynamical Systems**. In particular, my research is directed toward data-driven model reduction methods in the context of stochastic dynamical systems. 

Previously, I was a Postdoctoral Fellow at Johns Hopkins University. I received a PhD in applied math from the University of Washington, advised by Hong Qian. Here is my latest [CV](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/3zv6yn86dgl4a2rs9kpmp/NSF_style_Biographical_Sketch-1.pdf?rlkey=uyx0bwsya2akh8rkmn4m002sz&st=hlh0ydxf&dl=0) and [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=XOUnkpUAAAAJ&hl=en).

### Teaching
In Fall 2025, I am teaching Machine Learning (AMAT592).
In Spring 2026, I am teaching Practical Machine Learning (AMAT 593).




### Miscellaneous
This is an [article](https://amath.washington.edu/news/2018/10/25/it-was-roller-coaster-ride) I wrote after I graduate from University of Washington.

I am a mentor for [Prison Mathematics Project](https://www.prisonmathproject.org/).
